## Agile software development cycle
#### Git
1. If you don't have the Git CLI (*do not use GitHub Desktop*), run through [this guide to installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. If you're not too familiar with Git (e.g. you don't quite understand how branches/merging works), complete [this Git tutorial](https://try.github.io).
3. Read [this quick article on writing good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

#### Kanban boards
Just update your progress on the repo's Kanban Boards as you go along. I'll set these up beforehand for everyone, with pre-populated and assigned issues for everyone to complete. This is under the *Projects* tab on the repo page.

#### HTML/CSS/JavaScript
