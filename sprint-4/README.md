## Sprint 4

This sprint is focused on learning about REST APIs. We will use what we learn to start building the backend. As with the last sprint, keep updating your progress on the repo's Kanban Boards as you go along.

__Since other people are going to be on this repo as well, please don't merge anything back into `master`&mdash;just work on your own branch.__
