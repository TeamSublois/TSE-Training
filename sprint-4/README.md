## Sprint 4

This sprint is focused on getting familiar with React and React Native. As with the last sprint, keep updating your progress on the repo's Kanban Boards as you go along.

### React
Now that you've gotten a feel for node, templating, and JSON, we will move on to React Native. Since React Native is based on React, we will look at that first. 

What is React? From the docs, 
> React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

1. Install React by following [this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html)
2. Follow [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) from the official site to build a tic-tac-toe game

### React Native
From the docs,
> React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks

1. Read through the *Basics* in the [official docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).
2. Follow [this tutorial](http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/uber) to build your own Uber app.

#### Optional
- Follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-youtube-replica-f378200d91f0) to build a YouTube app.
- Use [this tutorial](https://themeteorchef.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-react-native-app-with-meteor) to build the "Trip Revisor" app.

__Since other people are going to be on this repo as well, please don't merge anything back into `master`&mdash;just work on your own branch.__
