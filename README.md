Hey y'all. This is just a couple exercises to get you guys a bit more acquainted with the basics of web dev.

Reach out if you're having trouble with any of it and communicate with me if anything comes up that makes it difficult for you to finish tasks in time (e.g. classwork, midterms, breakup, whatever) or if I just underestimated how much time everything would take and assigned an absurd amount of work.

## Windows
Web dev is hard on Windows and the lack of a Unix shell *can* make things harder to use and set up than they already are.

- [Linux Subsystem for Windows 10](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)
- [Powershell](), [cmder](http://cmder.net/), and [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) are all Command Prompt alternatives with support for Unix-like commands and lots of customizability.

**Since other people are going to be on this repo as well, please don't merge anything back into masterâ€”just work on your own branch.**
