Hey y'all. This is just a couple exercises to get you guys a bit more acquainted with the basics of web dev.

Reach out if you're having trouble with any of it and communicate with me if anything comes up that makes it difficult for you to finish tasks in time (e.g. classwork, midterms, breakup, whatever) or if I just underestimated how much time everything would take and assigned an absurd amount of work.
