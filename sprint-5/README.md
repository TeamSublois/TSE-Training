## React Native
This doc is focused on helping you get familiar with React and React Native.

### React
Now that you've gotten a feel for node, templating, and JSON, we will move on to React Native. Since React Native is based on React, we will look at that first. 

What is React? From the docs, 
> React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

1. Install React by following [this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html)
2. Follow [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) from the official site to build a tic-tac-toe game

**Optional:**  
Use this [comprehensive tutorial](https://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/) as a guide for things you don't understand from the official docs or want more info/examples on.

Almost everything that you learn about React will apply to React Native so the better you understand it, the easier React Native will be.

### React Native
From the docs,
> React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks

0. Install React Native following the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html )
1. Read through the *Basics* in the [official docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).
2. Read about [props](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props.html)
3. Read about [state](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state.html)

**Optional:**  
- [Build with React Tutorial](http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial)
- [React Native Express*](http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/)  

Some Notes: 
- Generally Redux and GraphQL is considered an advance topic and better to learn after you've mastered the basics (i.e. sections 6.2-6.4, 7.2, 8.1). Neither are required for basic React Native apps.  
- If you can build the exercises at the end, THAT'S AWESOME!
